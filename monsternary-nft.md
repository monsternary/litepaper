# Monsternary NFT

### Monsternary NFTs (Stage 1)

The intent of Monsternary is to provide utility to both land and equipment NFTs. NFTs are available in the following types and rarities:

#### Land NFTs:&#x20;

| Rarity     | Chance of Occurrence |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Common     | 50%                  |
| Uncommon   | 30%                  |
| Rare       | 10%                  |
| Epic       | 6%                   |
| Legendary  | 2%                   |
| Mythic     | 0.2%                 |

Depending on rarity, Monster NFTs produce different baseline amounts of resources and economic output. Different rarities may produce more or less of a particular type of resource.

#### Equipment NFTs:

Equipment NFTs will have the same rarity dispersion as Monsternary NFTs, for each equipment type. The equipment types in Stage 1 of the game include:

1.  Stardust

    Stardust is used to upgrade the level of monsters, how much stardust will be used depends on the level of each monster and also the level of the player. This stardust cannot be purchased in the marketplace and can only be obtained from adventures and monster battles.
2.  XP

    XP is the experience gained by the player to level up the player. Each player level will affect the monster level as well. Players who have a high level will get more benefits, because they can upgrade monsters and have more chances to win.
3.  Berries

    Berries adalah equipment monster untuk menambah kekuatan. Berries bisa di dapatkan dari rewards pertarungan ataupun dapat di beli dengan $MONS token di marketplace.
